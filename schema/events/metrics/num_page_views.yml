  A pageview is defined as a view of a page on your site that is being tracked
  by the Analytics tracking code. If a user clicks reload after reaching the
  page, this is counted as an additional pageview. If a user navigates to a
  different page and then returns to the original page, a second pageview is
  recorded as well.
